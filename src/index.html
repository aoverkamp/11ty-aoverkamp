<p class="lead">I'm Anthony Overkamp, an artist & design leader who blends strategy, systems thinking, and mentorship to help teams deliver high-quality work at scale. As a designer, Iâ€™m passionate about solving human problems by creating clean, memorable human experiences.</p>
<p>Outside of web & graphic work, I enjoy practicing martial arts, traveling with family and friends, and capturing moments through photography, drawing, and painting.</p>
